<p>
We created a Viking Blacksmith VR experience in association with Den Fynske Spilfabrik.
<br><br>
Our VR experience was made for a Danish Viking museum. Once you enter this immersive environment, you get taken back to the Viking age.
Here you have the opportunity to use a hammer and an anvil to forge your own blade.
Being in this environment takes you back to a simpler time and gives you a realistic view on how professions worked several hundred years ago.
The Viking Blacksmith game has been used as an attraction in two Viking museums in the country. Since its release for HTC Vive, it has also been ported for Oculus Rift.

<p>
We teamed up with the film company Zentropa to create a virtual reality experience as a promotion for their movie “Snedronningen”.
<br><br>
In this game you are trapped inside the Snow Queen’s ice filled cave. You find yourself trapped with no way of escaping.
All you can do is listen to the Ice Queen insulting you. In the end, you get killed by the Ice Queen after she drains the lifeforce out of you.
The game launch was covered by TV2 and received a good appraisal by Peter Ålbæk Jensen, who was present during the event.

We’ve made a Virtual Reality experience in collaboration with Østfyns Museer.
<br><br>
In this experience, you can interact with a miniature model of the castle.
You are able to read about points of interests in the castle.
You also have the opportunity to switch between how the castle looked in the year of 1200 and 1500 AD.
<br><br>
“The quality of the product was far beyond expectations. Attention to detail & user experience was in focus.”
<br>
-Nicolai Knudsen, Museum Curator, Østfyns Museer.
