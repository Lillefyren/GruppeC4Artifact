    <article class="product_article">We created a Viking Blacksmith VR experience in association with Den Fynske Spilfabrik. Our VR experience was made for a Danish Viking museum. Once you enter this immersive environment, you get taken back to the Viking age. Here you have the opportunity to use a hammer and an anvil to forge your own blade.
Being in this environment takes you back to a simpler time and gives you a realistic view on how professions worked several hundred years ago.
The Viking Blacksmith game has been used as an attraction in two Viking museums in the country. Since its release for HTC Vive, it has also been ported for Oculus Rift.
